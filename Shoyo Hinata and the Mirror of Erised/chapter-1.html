      <h4> Author's Notes/Summary: </h4>
      <p>
      This story is a weird mix of me trying to preserve the origin cultures of both Haikyuu and Harry Potter. So, it results in a hodgepodge of both. All characters will generally be referred to by last names with teachers or other adults generally getting a respectful prefix (Mr., Ms., ext.) rather than suffix.
