      <h4> Author's Notes/Summary: </h4>
      <p>
        As a note, I try very hard not to make any canon HQ!! characters actual villains. Instead, I try to stick with canon characteristics. In other words, they have flaws and may go through significant character development but they're not going to be bad people.

  Next, I try to avoid OCs when possible. For the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I'm following book logic and having a new one every year. Because of this, I elected not to waste a canon character for a one year position. All other students mentioned are actual HQ!! characters.

  Hope you enjoy!
