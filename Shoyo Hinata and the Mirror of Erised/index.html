          "On a rare sunny morning in late August, a man stood poised to knock on the front door of Privet Orphanage. His name was Ittetsu Takeda, Transfiguration Professor and Deputy Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Takeda was here to deliver a very special invitation to a very special boy by the name of Shouyou Hinata. </p>
<p> A Harry Potter style AU featuring friendship, prejudice, adventure, and mystery."
