        "Compared to future chapters, this chapter is probably the most reminiscent of its Philosopher's Stone/Sorcerer's Stone counterpart. Later chapters will veer off the main course, but I had to give Hinata the magic of a first trip to Diagon Alley. I tried to avoid established Hogwarts characters when possible, but it felt too odd to not have a Madam Malkin. Also, I decided to use Gregorovitch instead of Ollivander because Ollivander's characterization has already been firmly established in Harry Potter."
